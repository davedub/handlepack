Tracking [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkEZWD8wbltnRp6nRR8kv97RbpcUdNawY) by Petr Tichy, a/k/a [ihatetomatoes](https://ihatetomatoes.net/), for Webpack 2 setup and configuration. This branch through Video 12, for adding Bootstrap 4 (different than the video which uses Bootstrap 3). Last lesson reviewed how to output images from CSS and a static or template source file using [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader), and how to optimize images using [image-webpack-loader](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader).

## 2020 update

Master branch merged with Bootstrap branch and updated with Webpack 4. Earlier errors and problems solved for now. Interesting learning project but no obvious practical use.
