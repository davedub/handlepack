# handlepack

An attempt to get [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) template loader for [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) working. Good on partials, not good on helpers. 

Also loading pre-compiled Sass and PostCSS styles (that works OK).

## Installation

`npm install`

## Compile

`npm run dev`

There is no web server hooked up to this, just checking to see how pre-compiled assets work in Webpack, with mixed results (so far) using Handlebars instead of default.
