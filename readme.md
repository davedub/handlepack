Tracking [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkEZWD8wbltnRp6nRR8kv97RbpcUdNawY) by Petr Tichy, a/k/a [ihatetomatoes](https://ihatetomatoes.net/), for Webpack 2 setup and configuration. This branch through Video 12, for adding Bootstrap 4 (different than the video which uses Bootstrap 3).

Last lesson reviewed how to output images from CSS and a static or template source file using [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader), and how to optimize images using [image-webpack-loader](https://github.com/tcoopman/image-webpack-loader).

## 2019 update

Master branch merged with Bootstrap branch and updated with Webpack 4 but various errors and problems persist. Interesting learning project but no practical use. Do not proceed further with this project.
