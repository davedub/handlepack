# handlepack

An attempt to get [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com) template loader for [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack). working.

## Installation

`npm install`

## Compile

`npm run dev`

There is no web server hooked up to this, just checking to see how pre-compiled assets work in Webpack, with mixed results (so far) using Handlebars instead of default.
